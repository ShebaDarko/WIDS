        <h2>"WiDS Erlargen Makes History as the Trailblazing Host of the First International Conference at DDS, FAU!"</h2>
        <p>We are delighted to share exciting highlights from the recently concluded WiDs (Women in Data Science) conference, which took significant strides towards addressing the underrepresentation of women in the field. The conference successfully united professionals and enthusiasts from diverse backgrounds within the realm of data science.
 
The aim of the WiDs conference was to foster inclusivity and provide a platform for women to showcase their expertise, experiences, and accomplishments in the data science domain. Held as part of the annual WiDs worldwide conference, organized by Stanford University and hosted in over 200 locations globally, this year's event was particularly special as it marked the first time FAU had the privilege of hosting such an inspiring gathering.

The event featured a diverse range of speakers who shared their knowledge and experiences in areas such as machine learning, data visualization, and ethics in AI.

A team of dedicated students with Bathsheba Darko as the (WiDS Erlangen Ambassador), Aadityan KurUngat(Co-Ambassador), Supraja Ramesh(Co-Ambassador), Dr. Marius Yamakou and student volunteers contributed to make this event a success.
